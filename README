Linaro publishing platform
==========================

Linaro provides regular builds of Ubuntu, Android, OpenEmbedded, kernels,
toolchains for supported ARM boards.  They all have slightly differing
goals and purposes, and require slightly different publication rules.

This code provides a django application allowing restricted and controlled
access to any published results.  It also contains code which allows for
publishing in according to structure that the django application requires.

This code is behind snapshots.linaro.org and releases.linaro.org.

Features
--------
 * makes use of the regular directory structure on disk
 * click through licensing with each file potentially having a different
   license/theme
 * openid restrictions (by Launchpad teams)
 * post-processing of all uploads (a script that manages uploads)
 * per-IP pass-through (for automatic services like a test framework)

Background
----------
This code originated as mod_rewrite hacks to provide click-through licensing
for tarballs containing "binary blobs"â€”pieces of binary-only code
which enable extra features like accelerated graphics or multimedia.
These pieces are distributed under a separate license, and downloading
images or collections containing them requires some sort of license
protection.

However, over time, more and more features were added until a point where
it was necessary to switch to a better framework for web application
development such as apache+mod_python+django+mod_xsendfile.

Installation and setup
----------------------

See INSTALL file.

Publishing new builds
---------------------

To publish a new build, one should include a BUILD-INFO.txt file with
the build artifacts (see below for the description of the BUILD-INFO.txt
syntax).

BUILD-INFO.txt file will allow one to specify the access restrictions
(such as click-through licensing and OpenID-restrictions) and influence
the display (such as license-theme) of a particular build.

WARNING: if you want a build type to be protected by OpenID, you need to
ensure that the appropriate team is added to the list of django groups
in the database.  Only django admins can do that.

Next step is to ensure that

  scripts/publish_to_snapshots.py

has support for your build type.  Builds are originally placed into
a single, private location on the target server, and expect a run of
the above script for them to be placed in the right area.  This script
can (and should) do any post-processing and checks for your build before
it is placed in the public area for downloading.

Your jenkins job (or whatever is doing the build and pushing the artifacts)
should use push-over-ssh to push the builds to the server first, and then
trigger a run of "scripts/publish_to_snapshots.py" with appropriate parameters
to get it placed under the relevant subtree.

This ensures that no incomplete files are ever offered for download, and
allows postprocessing in a secure and controlled manner.

After that, if scripts/publish_to_snapshots.py is configured to push
to the right location, your build files should show up on the host
running the django application.  BUILD-INFO configuration will take effect,
so it may be inaccessible to the general public.


Build-Info support
------------------

BUILD-INFO.txt format
.....................

Paragraphs
..........

 * Header paragraph
 * Files paragraph

Header paragraph (once)
.......................

The following fields must be present in a header paragraph:
 * Format-Version: (required)
    Version of the BUILD-INFO format.

Files paragraph (repeatable)
............................

The following fields may be present in a files paragraph:
 * Files-Pattern: (required, must be the first field in the paragraph)
    Comma separated filename patterns that are specified using a simplified
    shell glob syntax. Will be used to identify protected files.
 * Build-Name: (optional)
    Would be unique over all the builds of the same type. For now used as
    a placeholder and will be ignored. To be added later by build services?
 * License-Type: (required)
    open - Open builds. No license page is displayed.
    protected - EULA protected builds. If 'OpenID-Launchpad-Teams' is defined
      then OpenID protection is used, otherwise simple Accept/Decline license
      page is displayed before accessing protected files.
 * Theme: (required only if License-Type is 'protected')
    Acceptable values are: stericsson, samsung.
    Theme name for selecting proper theming on download and license pages.
 * OpenID-Launchpad-Teams: (optional)
    LP team names, members of which are allowed to access protected files. No
    OpenID protection if absent.
 * Collect-User-Data: (optional)
    Acceptable values are: yes, no.
    Defaults to 'no' if not present. If the field is set to 'yes' then
    Name and E-Mail (some other fields?) fields are asked to be filled. If it
    will be needed in the future it could be expanded with
    'Collect-User-Data-Fields' field later or any other approach.
 * License-Text: (required only if License-Type is 'protected')
     EULA full text included in BUILD-INFO.txt

- If line begins with space character ' ' it is treated as a part of last found
variable which turns as multiline variable and is appended to it.
- Field names are case insensitive.
- Fields order doesn't matter, except 'Files-Pattern'

BUILD-INFO.txt example:
.......................

Format-Version: 0.1

Files-Pattern: *.img, *.tar.bz2
Build-Name: landing-snowball
License-Type: protected
Theme: stericsson
License-Text: EULA full text displayed to user.
 You should accept to download file.

Files-Pattern: *.txt
Bulid-Name: landing-snowball
License-Type: open


License protection script takes information from the BUILD-INFO.txt file placed
in the same directory as artifacts, finds 'Files-Pattern' block corresponding
to requested file and applies rules from that block to download procedure.
If no BUILD-INFO.txt is found it falls back to per-file/per-directory EULA
protection.

Custom scripts
--------------

Validation
..........

The validation script purpose is to discover and print the list of
directories which contain a build but do not have any kind of licensing
protection. Furthermore, it will list all *origen* and *snowball* build
paths which contain OPEN-EULA license and print out all the build paths where
the BUILD-INFO is used but which are not covered by build info patterns.
Usage:

./validation.py root_builds_dir
