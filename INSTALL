Linaro publishing platform installation
=======================================

Linaro publishing platform currently consists of two separate parts:

 * upload system
 * web site for downloads


Dependencies

 * python
 * apache2
 * libapache2-mod-python
 * libapache2-mod-xsendfile (>=0.10)
 * python-django (>=1.3.1)
 * python-django-openid

 * python-requests

To do development, you need a few more dependencies.  Please check the
HACKING file.


Tests
-----

Testing infrastructure is based on 'testrepository' and requires at least
Python and Apache2:

To run tests for upload system and helper scripts:

  $ testr init
  $ testr run

To run tests for Django application:

  $ python manage.py test

Test plans
..........

To run the test plans from testplans/ subdirectory against
snapshots.linaro.org and releases.linaro.org, execute the following:

  $ testr init
  $ testr run testplans.test_suite

These tests require an internet connection.


Deployment
----------

For current Linaro deployment, please see

  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~linaro-automation/linaro-license-protection/configs/view/head:/README


Upload system
-------------

Upload system deals with files in a private location and moves them into
a corresponding subdirectory under the public location (being served through
the web site).

Refer to the Linaro deployment document above to see an example setup.

Web site for downloads
----------------------

This is a django application, so standard django steps apply:

 ./manage.py syncdb
 ./manage.py collectstatic
 ./manage.py runserver

A configuration with mod_wsgi is described in the Linaro deployment README
(referred to above).
