Linaro Ansible Common
=====================

A container for a common Ansible role. This is meant to be used as a subtree
when starting to work on a new ansible playbook.

The prefix where this should be stored is under roles/common/ in a role-based
playbook. From the playbook, then just use the "common" role.

To include it:

    git remote add ansible_common $PATH_TO_THIS_REPO
    git fetch ansible_common
    git read-tree --prefix=common/ -u ansible_common

Then commit normally.

Alternatively, you can use it as an external source for a role. In this case
you need to tell Ansible where to look for roles. Please refer to Ansible
documentation.
